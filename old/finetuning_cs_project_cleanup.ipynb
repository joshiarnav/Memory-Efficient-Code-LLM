The instruction contains concepts formatted as a list of keyword and value pairs separated by newline. The list of concept keywords and their descriptions are:\\n\\n### Keywords:\\n\\n[in] What specific function or class to focus on to implement the required change(s).\\n\\n[+] What specific library, programming or data structure or design concept, or programmer-defined construct in the code to USE or ADD to implement the required change(s)\\n\\n[-] What specific library, programming or data structure or design concept, or programmer-defined construct in the code to NOT USE or REMOVE to implement the required change(s)\\n\\n[implement] What specific function to implement in the class of interest\\n\\n[override] What specific function of the parent class to override and implement in the class of interest\\n\\n[hint] Full or partial textual description of the idea to implement\\n\\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request.\\n\\n### Instruction:\\nResolve potential memory issues in the code described in the following: The code reads one line of the index file at a time. The entire index is only on about 5 lines, thus the 5th line is about 2mb. The solution here is to switch to reading a fixed length of 4096 characters at a time rather than entire lines. Use a custom tokenizer rather than Java String methods such as indexOf. Write the entire code and no other text in the response.\\n\\n### Concepts:\\n[in] countSubstringOccurrence(File file, String substring) function\\n[-] countSubstringOccurrence(String toSearch, String substring) function\\n[-] BufferedReader\\n[+] FileReader\\n[hint] use a character buffer of size 4096.\\n\\n### Given program:\\n```java\\n/*\\n * Copyright (C) 2010-12  Ciaran Gultnieks, ciaran@ciarang.com\\n *\\n * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\\n * modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\\n * as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3\\n * of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\\n *\\n * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\\n * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\\n * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
