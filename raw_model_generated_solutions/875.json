The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.\n\n\nKoko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.\n\n\nKoko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.\n\n\nReturn *the minimum integer* `k` *such that she can eat all the bananas within* `h` *hours*.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8\n**Output:** 4\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5\n**Output:** 30\n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6\n**Output:** 23\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= piles.length <= 104`\n* `piles.length <= h <= 109`\n* `1 <= piles[i] <= 109`\n\n\n",

    "model_generation": "The provided solution is inefficient because it uses two nested while loops to check the condition for the eating speed `k`. This results in a time complexity of O(n*h) where n is the number of piles and h is the number of hours.\n\nHere's a more efficient solution using binary search:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:\n        def check(k):\n            return sum((pile + k - 1) // k for pile in piles) <= h\n\n        left, right = 1, max(piles)\n        while left < right:\n            mid = left + (right - left) // 2\n            if check(mid):\n                right = mid\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n        return left\n```\n\nThis solution first defines a helper function `check(k)` that returns True if it's possible to eat all the bananas within `h` hours at a speed of `k`. The main function then uses binary search to find the minimum speed `k` that satisfies the condition.\n\nThe binary search is more efficient because it only needs to check each possible value of `k` once, whereas the original solution needs to check each value multiple times.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log max(piles)) where n is the number of piles and max(piles) is the maximum number of bananas in a pile. This is because the `check(k)` function needs to iterate over all the piles once, and the binary search needs to iterate over the possible values of `k` logarithmically.",
