It can be shown that the length of the resulting string would be at least 6 and \"aaabca\" is the lexicographically smallest one.\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** a = \"ab\", b = \"ba\", c = \"aba\"\n**Output:** \"aba\"\n**Explanation:** We show that the string \"aba\" contains all the given strings: a = ans[0..1], b = ans[1..2], c = ans[0..2]. Since the length of c is 3, the length of the resulting string would be at least 3. It can be shown that \"aba\" is the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= a.length, b.length, c.length <= 100`\n* `a`, `b`, `c` consist only of lowercase English letters.\n\n\n",

It tries all possible combinations of substrings of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and checks if the length of the combined string is equal to the current length. If it is, it returns the string.\n2.  **Loop Through Lengths from Longest to Shortest**: The code starts with the longest possible length and loops through lengths from longest to shortest. This is because it's more efficient to start with the longest possible length and try to find a string with that length, rather than starting with the shortest possible length and trying to find a string with that length.\n3.  **Loop Through Different Orderings of Substrings**: The code loops through different orderings of substrings of `a`, `b`, and `c`. This is because the order in which the substrings are combined can affect the length of the resulting string.\n4.  **Return the Lexicographically Smallest String**: If no string with the desired length is found, the code returns the lexicographically smallest string that contains all three strings as substrings. This is because the problem statement specifies that if there are multiple strings with the same length, the lexicographically smallest one should be returned.\n\n### Time Complexity:**\n\nThe time complexity of the above code is O(n^3 \\* m), where n is the maximum length of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and m is the number of lengths to try. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the maximum length of `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\n### Note:**\n\nThe above code assumes that the input strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-empty and consist only of lowercase English letters. The code also assumes that the length of the resulting string is at least 1. If these assumptions are not met, the code may not work correctly.",
