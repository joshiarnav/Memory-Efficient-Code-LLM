The key idea is to create a DP table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents whether the string `s[:i]` can be segmented into dictionary words.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n1. Initialize the DP table `dp` with `False` values, except for `dp[0]`, which is set to `True`.\n2. Iterate over the string `s` from left to right.\n3. For each position `i`, iterate over all previous positions `j`.\n4. If `dp[j]` is `True` and the substring `s[j:i]` is in the word dictionary, set `dp[i]` to `True`.\n5. Break out of the inner loop as soon as `dp[i]` is set to `True`, since we don't need to consider other previous positions.\n6. Return the last element of the DP table `dp[-1]`, which indicates whether the entire string `s` can be segmented into dictionary words.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we iterate over the string `s` twice: once for the outer loop and once for the inner loop. The space complexity is O(n), since we need to store the DP table `dp` of size n+1.",
