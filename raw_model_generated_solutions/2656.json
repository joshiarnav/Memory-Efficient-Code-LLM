    "description": "\nYou are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to perform the following operation **exactly** `k` times in order to maximize your score:\n\n\n1. Select an element `m` from `nums`.\n2. Remove the selected element `m` from the array.\n3. Add a new element with a value of `m + 1` to the array.\n4. Increase your score by `m`.\n\n\nReturn *the maximum score you can achieve after performing the operation exactly* `k` *times.*\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3\n**Output:** 18\n**Explanation:** We need to choose exactly 3 elements from nums to maximize the sum.\nFor the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [1,2,3,4,6]\nFor the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 and nums = [1,2,3,4,7]\nFor the third iteration, we choose 7. Then sum is 5 + 6 + 7 = 18 and nums = [1,2,3,4,8]\nSo, we will return 18.\nIt can be proven, that 18 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [5,5,5], k = 2\n**Output:** 11\n**Explanation:** We need to choose exactly 2 elements from nums to maximize the sum.\nFor the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [5,5,6]\nFor the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 = 11 and nums = [5,5,7]\nSo, we will return 11.\nIt can be proven, that 11 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`\n* `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`\n* `1 <= k <= 100`\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n.spoilerbutton {display:block; border:dashed; padding: 0px 0px; margin:10px 0px; font-size:150%; font-weight: bold; color:#000000; background-color:cyan; outline:0; \n}\n.spoiler {overflow:hidden;}\n.spoiler > div {-webkit-transition: all 0s ease;-moz-transition: margin 0s ease;-o-transition: all 0s ease;transition: margin 0s ease;}\n.spoilerbutton[value=\"Show Message\"] + .spoiler > div {margin-top:-500%;}\n.spoilerbutton[value=\"Hide Message\"] + .spoiler {padding:5px;}\n\n",

It then iterates `k` times, adding the maximum value to the sum, incrementing the maximum value, and updating the frequency of the new value. If the count of the maximum value is 1, it removes the maximum value from the frequency dictionary; otherwise, it decrements the count of the maximum value and increments the count of the new value. This process continues until the operation has been performed `k` times, at which point the maximum sum is returned.",
