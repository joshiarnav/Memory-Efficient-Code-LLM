    "model_generation": "### Efficient Solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:\n        s = s.strip()  # Remove leading and trailing spaces\n        words = s.split()  # Split the string into words\n        reversed_words = ' '.join(reversed(words))  # Reverse the order of words and join them with a space\n        return reversed_words\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe provided inefficient solution has a time complexity of O(n) due to the additional loop to add spaces between words. However, we can achieve the same result in a single line of code by using the `join` function with the `reversed` function.\n\n1. We first remove the leading and trailing spaces from the input string `s` using the `strip` method.\n2. Then, we split the string into words using the `split` method.\n3. Next, we use the `reversed` function to reverse the order of the words.\n4. Finally, we use the `join` function to concatenate the reversed words with a space in between.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of words in the string. The space complexity is also O(n) as we store the reversed words in a list. \n\n### In-Place Solution with O(1) Extra Space:\n\nIf the string data type is mutable in your language, we can solve this problem in-place with O(1) extra space using a two-pointer approach. However, this solution would be more complex and is not necessary for this problem.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:\n        def reverse(s, left, right):\n            while left < right:\n                s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]\n                left += 1\n                right -= 1\n\n        s = list(s)  # Convert the string to a list for in-place modification\n        s = s.strip()  # Remove leading and trailing spaces\n        length = len(s)\n        start = 0\n\n        for i in range(length):\n            if s[i] == ' ':\n                continue\n            end = i\n            while end < length - 1 and s[end + 1] != ' ':\n                end += 1\n            reverse(s, start, end)\n            start = i + 1\n\n        reverse(s, 0, length - 1)  # Reverse the entire string\n        return ''.join(s)\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1). However, it modifies the input string in-place, which may not be desirable in all cases.",
