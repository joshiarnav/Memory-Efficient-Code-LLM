    "description": "\nYou are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of **even** length.\n\n\nAs long as `nums` is **not** empty, you must repetitively:\n\n\n* Find the minimum number in `nums` and remove it.\n* Find the maximum number in `nums` and remove it.\n* Calculate the average of the two removed numbers.\n\n\nThe **average** of two numbers `a` and `b` is `(a + b) / 2`.\n\n\n* For example, the average of `2` and `3` is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.\n\n\nReturn *the number of **distinct** averages calculated using the above process*.\n\n\n**Note** that when there is a tie for a minimum or maximum number, any can be removed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [4,1,4,0,3,5]\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:**\n1. Remove 0 and 5, and the average is (0 + 5) / 2 = 2.5. Now, nums = [4,1,4,3].\n2. Remove 1 and 4. The average is (1 + 4) / 2 = 2.5, and nums = [4,3].\n3. Remove 3 and 4, and the average is (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5.\nSince there are 2 distinct numbers among 2.5, 2.5, and 3.5, we return 2.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [1,100]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:**\nThere is only one average to be calculated after removing 1 and 100, so we return 1.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `2 <= nums.length <= 100`\n* `nums.length` is even.\n* `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`\n\n\n",

We use the negative of each number in the min-heap to ensure that the smallest number (the one with the smallest negative value) is always at the top.\n*   We then remove the minimum and maximum elements from the heaps and calculate their average.\n*   After calculating the average, we update the list `nums` with the remaining elements from both heaps. This is because all remaining elements are candidates for being the next minimum or maximum element.\n*   We repeat the process until the list `nums` becomes empty, and finally return the number of distinct averages calculated.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the use of the heapify operation, which has a time complexity of O(n log k), where n is the number of elements and k is the size of the heap. In this case, k = n/2, so the time complexity simplifies to O(n log n). The space complexity is also O(n) due to the use of the heaps.\n\nThis solution is more efficient than the original solution because it uses heaps to efficiently remove the minimum and maximum elements from the list, reducing the time complexity of the overall algorithm.",
