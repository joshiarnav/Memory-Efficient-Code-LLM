    "description": "\nYou are given a floating-point number `hour`, representing the amount of time you have to reach the office. To commute to the office, you must take `n` trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array `dist` of length `n`, where `dist[i]` describes the distance (in kilometers) of the `ith` train ride.\n\n\nEach train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.\n\n\n* For example, if the `1st` train ride takes `1.5` hours, you must wait for an additional `0.5` hours before you can depart on the `2nd` train ride at the 2 hour mark.\n\n\nReturn *the **minimum positive integer** speed **(in kilometers per hour)** that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time, or* `-1` *if it is impossible to be on time*.\n\n\nTests are generated such that the answer will not exceed `107` and `hour` will have **at most two digits after the decimal point**.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** dist = [1,3,2], hour = 6\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** At speed 1:\n- The first train ride takes 1/1 = 1 hour.\n- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 1 hour mark. The second train takes 3/1 = 3 hours.\n- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 4 hour mark. The third train takes 2/1 = 2 hours.\n- You will arrive at exactly the 6 hour mark.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** dist = [1,3,2], hour = 2.7\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** At speed 3:\n- The first train ride takes 1/3 = 0.33333 hours.\n- Since we are not at an integer hour, we wait until the 1 hour mark to depart. The second train ride takes 3/3 = 1 hour.\n- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 2 hour mark. The third train takes 2/3 = 0.66667 hours.\n- You will arrive at the 2.66667 hour mark.\n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** dist = [1,3,2], hour = 1.9\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** It is impossible because the earliest the third train can depart is at the 2 hour mark.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `n == dist.length`\n* `1 <= n <= 105`\n* `1 <= dist[i] <= 105`\n* `1 <= hour <= 109`\n* There will be at most two digits after the decimal point in `hour`.\n\n\n",
