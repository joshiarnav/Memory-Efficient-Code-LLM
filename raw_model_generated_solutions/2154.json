    "description": "\nYou are given an array of integers `nums`. You are also given an integer `original` which is the first number that needs to be searched for in `nums`.\n\n\nYou then do the following steps:\n\n\n1. If `original` is found in `nums`, **multiply** it by two (i.e., set `original = 2 * original`).\n2. Otherwise, **stop** the process.\n3. **Repeat** this process with the new number as long as you keep finding the number.\n\n\nReturn *the **final** value of* `original`.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3\n**Output:** 24\n**Explanation:** \n- 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.\n- 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.\n- 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.\n- 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [2,7,9], original = 4\n**Output:** 4\n**Explanation:**\n- 4 is not found in nums. Thus, 4 is returned.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`\n* `1 <= nums[i], original <= 1000`\n\n\n",

    "model_generation": "Here's an efficient solution using a set to store the numbers from the `nums` array. This approach reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(1) for the initial setup.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def findFinalValue(self, nums: List[int], original: int) -> int:\n        num_set = set(nums)\n        \n        while original in num_set:\n            original *= 2\n        return original\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. We first convert the `nums` array into a set `num_set` for efficient lookups. This operation has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the size of the `nums` array.\n2. We then enter a while loop where we keep multiplying the `original` number by 2 as long as it exists in the `num_set`.\n3. Once the `original` number is no longer in the `num_set`, we break out of the loop and return the final value of `original`.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n + k) where n is the size of the `nums` array and k is the number of times the while loop iterates. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the numbers from the `nums` array in the set.\n\n**Note:** The while loop in this solution iterates at most log(k) times where k is the maximum value in the `nums` array. This is because each iteration doubles the value of `original`, effectively reducing the range of numbers by half each iteration. Therefore, the overall time complexity of this solution is O(n + log(k)).",
