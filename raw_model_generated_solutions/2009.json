Then, it tries to replace either the minimum value or the maximum value with each possible value to see if the array becomes continuous. If it does, it updates the minimum number of operations. Finally, it returns the minimum number of operations.\n\n### Time Complexity:\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. This is because in the worst case, it needs to try to replace each value with each possible value, which takes O(n^2) time. However, the actual time complexity is likely to be much less than this, as the array is likely to become continuous after trying a few values.",
