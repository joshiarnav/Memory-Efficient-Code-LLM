    "model_generation": "### Efficient Solution:\n\nWe can solve this problem more efficiently by using Python's built-in `set` data structure, which provides constant-time membership testing and removal of elements. Here's the improved solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def intersection(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Convert the input lists to sets for efficient membership testing\n        set1 = set(nums1)\n        set2 = set(nums2)\n        \n        # Find the intersection of the two sets by taking their difference with the complement of the other set\n        intersection = set1 & set2\n        \n        # Convert the intersection back to a list and return it\n        return list(intersection)\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the sizes of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively, because we need to create the sets from the input lists. The set operations (`&`, `|`, `-`, etc.) have an average time complexity of O(min(n, m)), but since we're doing this for two sets, the overall time complexity is O(n + m).\n\nThe space complexity is also O(n + m) because we need to store the input lists in the sets.\n\nThis solution is much more efficient than the original solution, especially for large input lists, because it avoids the need for iterating over all possible integers and uses the efficient membership testing and removal of elements provided by the `set` data structure.",
