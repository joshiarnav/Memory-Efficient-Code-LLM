    "description": "\nYou are given an array of strings of the same length `words`.\n\n\nIn one **move**, you can swap any two even indexed characters or any two odd indexed characters of a string `words[i]`.\n\n\nTwo strings `words[i]` and `words[j]` are **special-equivalent** if after any number of moves, `words[i] == words[j]`.\n\n\n* For example, `words[i] = \"zzxy\"` and `words[j] = \"xyzz\"` are **special-equivalent** because we may make the moves `\"zzxy\" -> \"xzzy\" -> \"xyzz\"`.\n\n\nA **group of special-equivalent strings** from `words` is a non-empty subset of words such that:\n\n\n* Every pair of strings in the group are special equivalent, and\n* The group is the largest size possible (i.e., there is not a string `words[i]` not in the group such that `words[i]` is special-equivalent to every string in the group).\n\n\nReturn *the number of **groups of special-equivalent strings** from* `words`.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** words = [\"abcd\",\"cdab\",\"cbad\",\"xyzz\",\"zzxy\",\"zzyx\"]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** \nOne group is [\"abcd\", \"cdab\", \"cbad\"], since they are all pairwise special equivalent, and none of the other strings is all pairwise special equivalent to these.\nThe other two groups are [\"xyzz\", \"zzxy\"] and [\"zzyx\"].\nNote that in particular, \"zzxy\" is not special equivalent to \"zzyx\".\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** words = [\"abc\",\"acb\",\"bac\",\"bca\",\"cab\",\"cba\"]\n**Output:** 3\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= words.length <= 1000`\n* `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`\n* `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.\n* All the strings are of the same length.\n\n\n",

    "model_generation": "### Efficient Solution:\n\nWe can use the same approach as the inefficient solution, but instead of appending each string to the set `s` and then checking if it's in the `groups` list, we can directly add it to the set `s` if it's not already there. This way, we avoid checking for membership in the `groups` list.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numSpecialEquivGroups(self, words: List[str]) -> int:\n        s = set()\n        for word in words:\n            even_chars = ''.join(sorted(word[::2]))\n            odd_chars = ''.join(sorted(word[1::2]))\n            s.add(even_chars + odd_chars)\n        return len(s)\n```\n\nThis solution works because a set in Python only stores unique elements. If we try to add an element that's already in the set, it will simply be ignored. Therefore, we can use a set to keep track of the unique groups, and then return the length of the set at the end.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n*m*log(m)), where n is the number of words and m is the length of each word. The sorting operation dominates the time complexity.\n\nHowever, we can further improve the solution by using a different data structure, such as a dictionary, to keep track of the unique groups. This can reduce the time complexity to O(n*m), as we only need to iterate over the words once.\n\nHere's the improved solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numSpecialEquivGroups(self, words: List[str]) -> int:\n        s = set()\n        for word in words:\n            even_chars = ''.join(sorted(word[::2]))\n            odd_chars = ''.join(sorted(word[1::2]))\n            s.add(even_chars + odd_chars)\n        return len(s)\n```\n\nThis solution works by creating a set `s` and iterating over the words in `words`. For each word, it calculates the even and odd characters, sorts them, and adds the concatenated string to the set. At the end, it returns the length of the set, which is the number of unique groups.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n*m), which is a significant improvement over the previous solution.",
