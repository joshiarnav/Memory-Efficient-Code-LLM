    "description": "\nThere are `n` different online courses numbered from `1` to `n`. You are given an array `courses` where `courses[i] = [durationi, lastDayi]` indicate that the `ith` course should be taken **continuously** for `durationi` days and must be finished before or on `lastDayi`.\n\n\nYou will start on the `1st` day and you cannot take two or more courses simultaneously.\n\n\nReturn *the maximum number of courses that you can take*.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** courses = [[100,200],[200,1300],[1000,1250],[2000,3200]]\n**Output:** 3\nExplanation: \nThere are totally 4 courses, but you can take 3 courses at most:\nFirst, take the 1st course, it costs 100 days so you will finish it on the 100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 101st day.\nSecond, take the 3rd course, it costs 1000 days so you will finish it on the 1100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 1101st day. \nThird, take the 2nd course, it costs 200 days so you will finish it on the 1300th day. \nThe 4th course cannot be taken now, since you will finish it on the 3300th day, which exceeds the closed date.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** courses = [[1,2]]\n**Output:** 1\n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** courses = [[3,2],[4,3]]\n**Output:** 0\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= courses.length <= 104`\n* `1 <= durationi, lastDayi <= 104`\n\n\n",

It iterates over the sorted courses and adds them to the heap if adding them does not exceed the deadline. If adding a course would exceed the deadline, it removes the longest course from the heap and adds the current course.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting and the heap operations. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the courses in the heap.\n\nThis solution is more efficient than the given solution because it uses a heap to keep track of the courses taken so far, which allows it to find the longest course to remove in constant time. The given solution uses a recursive approach, which can be slower due to the overhead of function calls and returns.",
