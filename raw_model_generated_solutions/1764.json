    "description": "\nYou are given a 2D integer array `groups` of length `n`. You are also given an integer array `nums`.\n\n\nYou are asked if you can choose `n` **disjoint** subarrays from the array `nums` such that the `ith` subarray is equal to `groups[i]` (**0-indexed**), and if `i > 0`, the `(i-1)th` subarray appears **before** the `ith` subarray in `nums` (i.e. the subarrays must be in the same order as `groups`).\n\n\nReturn `true` *if you can do this task, and* `false` *otherwise*.\n\n\nNote that the subarrays are **disjoint** if and only if there is no index `k` such that `nums[k]` belongs to more than one subarray. A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** groups = [[1,-1,-1],[3,-2,0]], nums = [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,3,-2,0]\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** You can choose the 0th subarray as [1,-1,0,**1,-1,-1**,3,-2,0] and the 1st one as [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,**3,-2,0**].\nThese subarrays are disjoint as they share no common nums[k] element.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** groups = [[10,-2],[1,2,3,4]], nums = [1,2,3,4,10,-2]\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** Note that choosing the subarrays [**1,2,3,4**,10,-2] and [1,2,3,4,**10,-2**] is incorrect because they are not in the same order as in groups.\n[10,-2] must come before [1,2,3,4].\n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** groups = [[1,2,3],[3,4]], nums = [7,7,1,2,3,4,7,7]\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** Note that choosing the subarrays [7,7,**1,2,3**,4,7,7] and [7,7,1,2,**3,4**,7,7] is invalid because they are not disjoint.\nThey share a common elements nums[4] (0-indexed).\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `groups.length == n`\n* `1 <= n <= 103`\n* `1 <= groups[i].length, sum(groups[i].length) <= 103`\n* `1 <= nums.length <= 103`\n* `-107 <= groups[i][j], nums[k] <= 107`\n\n\n",

If a match is found, increment the `i` counter to keep track of the number of groups found.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(m * n * len(g)) where m is the length of the `nums` array, n is the length of the `groups` array, and len(g) is the length of each group in the `groups` array. This is because in the worst case, we may need to check every element in the `nums` array for each group in the `groups` array.\n\nNote that we do not need to use a `while` loop to iterate over the `nums` array for each group in the `groups` array. Instead, we can use a single `while` loop to iterate over the `nums` array and find the first occurrence of each group in the `groups` array.\n\nAlso, we do not need to store the found groups in a list. Instead, we can simply keep track of the number of groups found using the `i` counter. This makes the solution more efficient in terms of memory usage.",
