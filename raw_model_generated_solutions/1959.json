    "description": "\nYou are currently designing a dynamic array. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is the number of elements that will be in the array at time `i`. In addition, you are given an integer `k`, the **maximum** number of times you can **resize** the array (to **any** size).\n\n\nThe size of the array at time `t`, `sizet`, must be at least `nums[t]` because there needs to be enough space in the array to hold all the elements. The **space wasted** at\u00a0time `t` is defined as `sizet - nums[t]`, and the **total** space wasted is the **sum** of the space wasted across every time `t` where `0 <= t < nums.length`.\n\n\nReturn *the **minimum** **total space wasted** if you can resize the array at most* `k` *times*.\n\n\n**Note:** The array can have **any size** at the start and does **not** count towards the number of resizing operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [10,20], k = 0\n**Output:** 10\n**Explanation:** size = [20,20].\nWe can set the initial size to be 20.\nThe total wasted space is (20 - 10) + (20 - 20) = 10.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [10,20,30], k = 1\n**Output:** 10\n**Explanation:** size = [20,20,30].\nWe can set the initial size to be 20 and resize to 30 at time 2. \nThe total wasted space is (20 - 10) + (20 - 20) + (30 - 30) = 10.\n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [10,20,15,30,20], k = 2\n**Output:** 15\n**Explanation:** size = [10,20,20,30,30].\nWe can set the initial size to 10, resize to 20 at time 1, and resize to 30 at time 3.\nThe total wasted space is (10 - 10) + (20 - 20) + (20 - 15) + (30 - 30) + (30 - 20) = 15.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= nums.length <= 200`\n* `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`\n* `0 <= k <= nums.length - 1`\n\n\n",

Initialize two lists `sizes` and `wasted` to track the total size occupied by the array and the wasted space at each time step, respectively.\n2.  Initialize a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum total wasted space up to time step `i` with `j` resizing operations.\n3.  Iterate over each time step `i`, and for each time step, iterate over each possible number of resizing operations `j` from 0 to `k`.\n4.  For each `j`, try two strategies: resizing at the current time step and not resizing at the current time step.\n    *   If resizing at the current time step, calculate the minimum total wasted space by considering the minimum total wasted space up to the previous time step with `j - 1` resizing operations, adding the wasted space at the current time step, and considering the maximum of the previous size and the new size after resizing.\n    *   If not resizing at the current time step, calculate the minimum total wasted space by considering the minimum total wasted space up to the previous time step with `j` resizing operations and adding the wasted space at the current time step.\n5.  Update `dp[i][j]` with the minimum total wasted space obtained from the two strategies.\n6.  Return the minimum total wasted space at the last time step with `k` resizing operations.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n \\* k), where n is the length of the input array `nums` and k is the maximum number of resizing operations. The space complexity is O(n \\* k) as well.",
