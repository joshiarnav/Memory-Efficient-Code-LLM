    "model_generation": "### Efficient Solution\n\nThe given problem can be solved more efficiently by considering the properties of the matrix and the constraints provided. We can observe that the maximum possible number of ones in a square sub-matrix of size `sideLength * sideLength` is equal to `maxOnes`. \n\nWe can iterate over the matrix in a row-major order, and for each cell, we can calculate the maximum possible number of ones in the current cell and its neighboring cells. The maximum possible number of ones in the current cell is `maxOnes` if the current cell is within the first `sideLength * sideLength` cells, and `maxOnes - 1` otherwise.\n\nHere's an efficient solution in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumNumberOfOnes(\n        self, width: int, height: int, sideLength: int, maxOnes: int\n    ) -> int:\n        # Initialize the matrix with zeros\n        matrix = [[0] * width for _ in range(height)]\n        \n        # Initialize the count of ones\n        ones = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over the matrix in a row-major order\n        for i in range(width):\n            for j in range(height):\n                # Calculate the maximum possible number of ones in the current cell\n                ones_in_cell = min(maxOnes, (sideLength - 1) * ((i + j) // sideLength) + 1)\n                \n                # Update the count of ones\n                ones += ones_in_cell\n        \n        # Return the maximum possible number of ones\n        return ones\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(width * height) and a space complexity of O(width * height). It efficiently calculates the maximum possible number of ones in the matrix based on the given constraints.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe solution works by iterating over the matrix in a row-major order and calculating the maximum possible number of ones in each cell. The maximum possible number of ones in a cell is determined by the position of the cell in the matrix, and it is calculated as `min(maxOnes, (sideLength - 1) * ((i + j) // sideLength) + 1)`, where `i` and `j` are the coordinates of the cell.\n\nThis formula works because the maximum possible number of ones in a cell is equal to `maxOnes` if the cell is within the first `sideLength * sideLength` cells, and `maxOnes - 1` otherwise. The `(i + j) // sideLength` term represents the number of cells to the left and above the current cell, and the `(sideLength - 1)` term represents the number of cells to the right and below the current cell.\n\nThe overall time complexity of the solution is O(width * height) because we are iterating over the matrix in a row-major order, and the space complexity is O(width * height) because we are creating a matrix of size width * height to store the count of ones.",
