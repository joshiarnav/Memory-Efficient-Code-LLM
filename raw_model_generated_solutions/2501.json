A subsequence of `nums` is called a **square streak** if:\n\n\n* The length of the subsequence is at least `2`, and\n* **after** sorting the subsequence, each element (except the first element) is the **square** of the previous number.\n\n\nReturn *the length of the **longest square streak** in* `nums`*, or return* `-1` *if there is no **square streak**.*\n\n\nA **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [4,3,6,16,8,2]\n**Output:** 3\n**Explanation:** Choose the subsequence [4,16,2]. After sorting it, it becomes [2,4,16].\n- 4 = 2 * 2.\n- 16 = 4 * 4.\nTherefore, [4,16,2] is a square streak.\nIt can be shown that every subsequence of length 4 is not a square streak.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [2,3,5,6,7]\n**Output:** -1\n**Explanation:** There is no square streak in nums so return -1.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `2 <= nums.length <= 105`\n* `2 <= nums[i] <= 105`\n\n\n",

The space complexity is also O(n). The use of memoization significantly reduces the number of redundant calculations, making the solution more efficient.\n\nHere's an explanation of the changes made to improve the efficiency of the solution:\n\n1.  We added a `memo` dictionary to store the length of the square streak for each number in the set.\n2.  Inside the while loop, we check if the current number `v` is in the `memo` dictionary. If it is, we update the value of `t` to be the maximum of the current value of `t` and the value stored in `memo[v]`. This is because we've already calculated the length of the square streak for this number and its square.\n3.  If the number `v` is not in the `memo` dictionary, we simply increment `t` by 1.\n4.  We store the updated value of `t` in the `memo` dictionary for the next iteration.\n5.  We also update the `ans` variable to be the maximum of its current value and the updated value of `t`.",
