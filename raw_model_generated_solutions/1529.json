    "model_generation": "### Efficient Solution:\n\nThe given problem can be solved more efficiently by using a greedy approach. We can iterate through the `target` string and maintain a variable `last_one_index` to store the index of the last encountered '1' in the `s` string.\n\nHere's an efficient solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minFlips(self, target: str) -> int:\n        n = len(target)\n        s = list(target)\n        last_one_index = -1\n        ans = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through the target string\n        for i in range(n):\n            # If the current character in target is '1'\n            if target[i] == '1':\n                # If last_one_index is -1, it means this is the first '1' encountered\n                # So, we need to flip all bits after this index to '1'\n                if last_one_index == -1:\n                    last_one_index = i\n                # If last_one_index is not -1, it means we have already encountered some '1's\n                # So, we need to flip all bits after last_one_index to '1'\n                else:\n                    last_one_index = i\n                # Flip all bits after last_one_index to '1'\n                for j in range(last_one_index + 1, i + 1):\n                    s[j] = '1' if s[j] == '0' else '0'\n                # Increment ans by 1 for each flip operation\n                ans += 1\n        \n        return ans\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the `target` string. The solution iterates through the `target` string once, maintaining a variable `last_one_index` to store the index of the last encountered '1' in the `s` string. If a '1' is encountered, it flips all bits after `last_one_index` to '1' and increments `ans` by 1. This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is performed to make `s` equal to `target`.",
