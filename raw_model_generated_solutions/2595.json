    "model_generation": "### Efficient Solution:\n\nHere's a more efficient solution that achieves the same result in fewer steps. This solution directly counts the even and odd indices with value '1' in the binary representation of `n` without storing the indices.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def evenOddBit(self, n: int) -> List[int]:\n        even_count = 0\n        odd_count = 0\n        while n:\n            bit = n & 1\n            n >>= 1\n            if bit:\n                even_count += n % 2 == 0\n                odd_count += not n % 2\n        return [even_count, odd_count]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThis solution uses bitwise operations to iterate through the binary representation of `n`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  `bit = n & 1`: This line extracts the least significant bit of `n` into the `bit` variable.\n2.  `n >>= 1`: This line shifts the bits of `n` one position to the right, effectively dividing `n` by 2 and discarding the remainder. This is equivalent to removing the least significant bit from `n`.\n3.  `if bit:`: If the least significant bit of `n` is 1, we count it as either even or odd based on its position.\n4.  `even_count += n % 2 == 0`: If the least significant bit of `n` is 1 and `n` is even, we increment the `even_count`.\n5.  `odd_count += not n % 2`: If the least significant bit of `n` is 1 and `n` is odd, we increment the `odd_count`.\n6.  The loop continues until `n` becomes 0, at which point we've processed all bits in the binary representation of the original `n`.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the input number, because it processes each bit in the binary representation of n once. The space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the counts.",
