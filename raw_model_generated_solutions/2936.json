    "description": "\nYou are given a **0-indexed** array of integers, `nums`. The following property holds for `nums`:\n\n\n* All occurrences of a value are adjacent. In other words, if there are two indices `i < j` such that `nums[i] == nums[j]`, then for every index `k` that `i < k < j`, `nums[k] == nums[i]`.\n\n\nSince `nums` is a very large array, you are given an instance of the class `BigArray` which has the following functions:\n\n\n* `int at(long long index)`: Returns the value of `nums[i]`.\n* `void size()`: Returns `nums.length`.\n\n\nLet's partition the array into **maximal** blocks such that each block contains **equal values**. Return *the number of these blocks.*\n\n\n**Note** that if you want to test your solution using a custom test, behavior for tests with `nums.length > 10` is undefined.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [3,3,3,3,3]\n**Output:** 1\n**Explanation:** There is only one block here which is the whole array (because all numbers are equal) and that is: [3,3,3,3,3]. So the answer would be 1. \n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,3,9,9,9,2,10,10]\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** There are 5 blocks here:\nBlock number 1: [1,1,1,3,9,9,9,2,10,10]\nBlock number 2: [1,1,1,3,9,9,9,2,10,10]\nBlock number 3: [1,1,1,3,9,9,9,2,10,10]\nBlock number 4: [1,1,1,3,9,9,9,2,10,10]\nBlock number 5: [1,1,1,3,9,9,9,2,10,10]\nSo the answer would be 5.\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** Since all numbers are distinct, there are 7 blocks here and each element representing one block. So the answer would be 7. \n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= nums.length <= 1015`\n* `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`\n* The input is generated such that all equal values are adjacent.\n* The sum of the elements of\u00a0`nums`\u00a0is at most\u00a0`1015`.\n\n\n",

It does this by keeping track of the current element and moving to the next one that is different. The `bisect_left` function is not necessary in this solution because we are already incrementing the index `i` whenever we move to the next element.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we are making a single pass through the array.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space. This is because we are not using any data structures that grow with the size of the array.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n```python\n# Example 1:\nnums = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\nprint(Solution().countBlocks(nums))  # Output: 1\n\n# Example 2:\nnums = [1, 1, 1, 3, 9, 9, 9, 2, 10, 10]\nprint(Solution().countBlocks(nums))  # Output: 5\n\n# Example 3:\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nprint(Solution().countBlocks(nums))  # Output: 7\n```",
