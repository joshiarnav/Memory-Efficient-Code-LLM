    "model_generation": "Here's an efficient solution using the built-in sorting function in Python, along with a custom sorting key.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def sortByBits(self, arr):\n        return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n*   We use the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which sorts the elements of the array in ascending order.\n*   We pass a custom sorting key to the `sorted` function using the `key` argument.\n*   The custom sorting key is a lambda function that takes an integer `x` as input and returns a tuple containing two elements:\n    *   The number of 1's in the binary representation of `x` (obtained using the `bin(x).count('1')` expression).\n    *   The value of `x` itself.\n*   When sorting the array, Python compares the tuples returned by the custom sorting key. If the number of 1's in the binary representation is the same for two integers, the integers are compared based on their values. This ensures that integers with the same number of 1's are sorted in ascending order.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(1) since we're not using any additional space that scales with the input size.",
