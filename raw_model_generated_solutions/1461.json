    "model_generation": "### Efficient Solution\n\nWe can use a sliding window approach along with a set to solve this problem efficiently. We will iterate over the string `s` and for each window of size `k`, we will add the binary code to a set. If the size of the set equals `2**k`, it means we have all possible binary codes of length `k` and we return `True`. If we reach the end of the string and the size of the set is less than `2**k`, it means we don't have all possible binary codes and we return `False`.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def hasAllCodes(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:\n        # Create a set to store unique binary codes of length k\n        codes = set()\n        \n        # Calculate the total number of unique binary codes of length k\n        total_codes = 1 << k\n        \n        # Iterate over the string s using a sliding window of size k\n        for i in range(len(s) - k + 1):\n            # Extract the binary code of length k from the string\n            code = int(s[i : i + k], 2)\n            \n            # Add the binary code to the set\n            codes.add(code)\n            \n            # If we have found all possible binary codes, return True\n            if len(codes) == total_codes:\n                return True\n        \n        # If we reach the end of the string and haven't found all possible binary codes, return False\n        return False\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the string `s` and a space complexity of O(m) where m is the total number of unique binary codes of length `k`.",
