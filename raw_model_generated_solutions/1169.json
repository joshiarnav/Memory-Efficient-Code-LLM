    "description": "\nA transaction is possibly invalid if:\n\n\n* the amount exceeds `$1000`, or;\n* if it occurs within (and including) `60` minutes of another transaction with the **same name** in a **different city**.\n\n\nYou are given an array of strings `transaction` where `transactions[i]` consists of comma-separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.\n\n\nReturn a list of `transactions` that are possibly invalid. You may return the answer in **any order**.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** transactions = [\"alice,20,800,mtv\",\"alice,50,100,beijing\"]\n**Output:** [\"alice,20,800,mtv\",\"alice,50,100,beijing\"]\n**Explanation:** The first transaction is invalid because the second transaction occurs within a difference of 60 minutes, have the same name and is in a different city. Similarly the second one is invalid too.\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** transactions = [\"alice,20,800,mtv\",\"alice,50,1200,mtv\"]\n**Output:** [\"alice,50,1200,mtv\"]\n\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** transactions = [\"alice,20,800,mtv\",\"bob,50,1200,mtv\"]\n**Output:** [\"bob,50,1200,mtv\"]\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `transactions.length <= 1000`\n* Each `transactions[i]` takes the form `\"{name},{time},{amount},{city}\"`\n* Each `{name}` and `{city}` consist of lowercase English letters, and have lengths between `1` and `10`.\n* Each `{time}` consist of digits, and represent an integer between `0` and `1000`.\n* Each `{amount}` consist of digits, and represent an integer between `0` and `2000`.\n\n\n",

If a transaction is invalid, it adds it to the `invalid` set. Finally, it returns the `invalid` set as a list.\n\nThe `processed` set is used to prevent processing each transaction multiple times, which would result in duplicate invalid transactions being added to the result.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of transactions. However, this is the best time complexity we can achieve for this problem, as we need to check each transaction with every other transaction.",
