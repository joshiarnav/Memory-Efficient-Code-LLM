    "description": "\nYou are given an integer array `nums`. We consider an array **good** if it is a permutation of an array `base[n]`.\n\n\n`base[n] = [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n]` (in other words, it is an array of length `n + 1` which contains `1` to `n - 1` exactly once, plus two occurrences of `n`). For example, `base[1] = [1, 1]` and `base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]`.\n\n\nReturn `true` *if the given array is good, otherwise return*`false`.\n\n\n**Note:** A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [2, 1, 3]\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. However, base[3] has four elements but array nums has three. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]. So the answer is false.\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [1, 3, 3, 2]\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3] (by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]). Therefore, the answer is true.\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [1, 1]\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** Since the maximum element of the array is 1, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 1. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[1] = [1, 1]. Therefore, the answer is true.\n```\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** nums = [3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1]\n**Output:** false\n**Explanation:** Since the maximum element of the array is 4, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 4. However, base[4] has five elements but array nums has six. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[4] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]. So the answer is false.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`\n* `1 <= num[i] <= 200`\n\n\n",
