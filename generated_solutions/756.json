    "description": "\nYou are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color, which is represented by a single letter. Each row of blocks contains **one less block** than the row beneath it and is centered on top.\n\n\nTo make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific **triangular patterns** that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a **single block** stacked on top of **two blocks**. The patterns are given\u00a0as a list of\u00a0three-letter strings `allowed`, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block.\n\n\n* For example, `\"ABC\"` represents a triangular pattern with a `'C'` block stacked on top of an `'A'` (left) and `'B'` (right) block. Note that this is different from `\"BAC\"` where `'B'` is on the left bottom and `'A'` is on the right bottom.\n\n\nYou start with a bottom row of blocks `bottom`, given as a single string, that you **must** use as the base of the pyramid.\n\n\nGiven `bottom` and `allowed`, return `true` *if you can build the pyramid all the way to the top such that **every triangular pattern** in the pyramid is in* `allowed`*, or* `false` *otherwise*.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n![](https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/doocs/leetcode@main/solution/0700-0799/0756.Pyramid%20Transition%20Matrix/images/pyramid1-grid.jpg)\n\n```\n\n**Input:** bottom = \"BCD\", allowed = [\"BCC\",\"CDE\",\"CEA\",\"FFF\"]\n**Output:** true\n**Explanation:** The allowed triangular patterns are shown on the right.\nStarting from the bottom (level 3), we can build \"CE\" on level 2 and then build \"A\" on level 1.\nThere are three triangular patterns in the pyramid, which are \"BCC\", \"CDE\", and \"CEA\".
