    "description": "\nThere is a tournament where `n` players are participating. The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from `1` to `n` based on their **initial** standing position (player `1` is the first player in the row, player `2` is the second player in the row, etc.).\n\n\nThe tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number `1`). In each round, the `ith` player from the front of the row competes against the `ith` player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.\n\n\n* For example, if the row consists of players `1, 2, 4, 6, 7`\n\t+ Player `1` competes against player `7`.\n\t+ Player `2` competes against player `6`.\n\t+ Player `4` automatically advances to the next round.\n\n\nAfter each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the **original ordering** assigned to them initially (ascending order).\n\n\nThe players numbered `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may **choose** the outcome of this round.\n\n\nGiven the integers `n`, `firstPlayer`, and `secondPlayer`, return *an integer array containing two values, the **earliest** possible round number and the\u00a0**latest** possible round number in which these two players will compete against each other, respectively*.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** n = 11, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 4\n**Output:** [3,4]\n**Explanation:**\nOne possible scenario which leads to the earliest round number:\nFirst round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\nSecond round: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11\nThird round: 2, 3, 4\nOne possible scenario which leads to the latest round number:\nFirst round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\nSecond round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nThird round: 1, 2, 4\nFourth round: 2, 4\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** n = 5, firstPlayer = 1, secondPlayer = 5\n**Output:** [1,1]\n**Explanation:** The players numbered 1 and 5 compete in the first round.\nThere is no way to make them compete in any other round.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `2 <= n <= 28`\n* `1 <= firstPlayer < secondPlayer <= n`\n\n\n",

When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.\n\n\n* For example, if the row consists of players `1, 2, 4, 6, 7`\n\t+ Player `1` competes against player `7`.\n\t+ Player `2` competes against player `6`.\n\t+ Player `4` automatically advances to the next round.\n\n\nAfter each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the **original ordering** assigned to them initially (ascending order).\n\n\nThe players numbered `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may **choose** the outcome of this round.\n\n\nGiven the integers `n`, `firstPlayer`, and `secondPlayer`, return *an integer array containing two values, the **earliest** possible round number and the\u00a0**latest** possible round number in which these two players will compete against each other, respectively*.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** n = 11, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 4\n**Output:** [3,4]\n**Explanation:**\nOne possible scenario which leads to the earliest round number:\nFirst round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\nSecond round: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11\nThird round: 2, 3, 4\nOne possible scenario which leads to the latest round number:\nFirst round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\nSecond round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nThird round: 1, 2, 4\nFourth round: 2, 4\n\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Input:** n = 5, firstPlayer = 1, secondPlayer = 5\n**Output:** [1,1]\n**Explanation:** The players numbered 1 and 5 compete in the first round.\nThere is no way to make them compete in any other round.\n\n```\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n\n* `2 <= n <= 28`\n* `1 <= firstPlayer < secondPlayer <= n`\n\n\n\n\n### Inefficient Solution:\nclass Solution:\n    def earliestAndLatest(\n        self, n: int, firstPlayer: int, secondPlayer: int\n    ) -> List[int]:\n        # Create a dictionary to store the dp results\n        dp = {}\n        \n        # Create a list of lists to store all dp results\n        dp_results = []\n        \n        # Create a list to store the values of k\n        k_values = []\n        \n        # Create a list to store the values of l\n        l_values = []\n        \n        # Create a list to store the values of r\n        r_values = []\n        \n        # Create a queue to store the values of (l, r, k)\n        queue = [(1, 1, 1)]\n        \n        # Mark the current iteration\n        iteration = 1\n        \n        while queue:\n            iteration += 1\n            \n            # Get the size of the queue\n            queue_size = len(queue)\n            \n            # Create a list to store the values of (a, b)\n            ab_values = []\n            \n            # Process each value in the queue\n            for _ in range(queue_size):\n                l, r, k = queue.pop(0)\n                \n                # Add the current values to the k_values list\n                k_values.append(k)\n                \n                # Add the current values to the l_values list\n                l_values.append(l)\n                \n                # Add the current values to the r_values list\n                r_values.append(r)\n                \n                # Check if the value (l, r, k) is already in the dp dictionary\n                if (l, r, k) in dp:\n                    # If it is, append the corresponding value to the ab_values list\n                    ab_values.append(dp[(l, r, k)])\n                else:\n                    # If it's not, calculate the value\n                    if l == r:\n                        ab_values.append([1, 1])\n                    elif l > r:\n                        ab_values.append(dp[(r, l, k)])\n                    else:\n                        # Calculate the values of a and b\n                        a = float('inf')\n                        b = -float('inf')\n                        \n                        # Enumerate all possible positions\n                        for i in range(1, l + 1):\n                            for j in range(l -
